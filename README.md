# Python DBMS - It's just a database

I made this database to prove my teacher that I can code :D

To use
```
python3 pydbms.py
```

I also made an example.py so you can get started with something.

Its MIT which means do whatever you wanna do with it but js dont say you wrote it.

Here's how it looks when ran:
